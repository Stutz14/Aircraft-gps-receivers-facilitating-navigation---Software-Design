Designed and implemented a Java-based aircraft navigation system integrating GPS receivers, autopilot control, and flight management modules. 
The system processes real-time GPS data from multiple sources (Honeywell and Rockwell), ensuring accurate navigation and coordinate comparison.
Developed modular components for command handling, state management, and control surface adjustments to optimize aircraft stability and automation. 
Used object-oriented programming, software design patterns, and modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. 
Key skills: Java, OOP, Software Design, GPS Data Processing, Flight Automation, Modular Programming.
